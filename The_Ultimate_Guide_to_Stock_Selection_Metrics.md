# The Ultimate Guide to Stock Selection Metrics for Long-Term, Short-Term, and Day Trading

Selecting the right stocks is critical for success in trading, whether you're holding for years, weeks, or just hours. Each trading horizon—long-term, short-term, and day trading—requires specific strategies and metrics to balance risk and reward. This guide explores key metrics for each horizon, grounded in proven financial theories like Value Investing, Momentum Trading, and Technical Analysis. Each metric includes its full name, description, and performance ranges (Poor, Good, Excellent) to help you make informed decisions. Whether you're new to trading or a seasoned investor, this guide will empower you to pick winning stocks.

## Understanding Trading Horizons

- **Long-Term Trading (Weeks to Years)**: Focuses on undervalued or growth stocks for capital appreciation or dividends, emphasizing fundamentals like earnings and financial health.
- **Short-Term Trading (Days to Weeks)**: Targets price trends or reversals, leveraging momentum and volatility for quick gains.
- **Day Trading (Minutes to Hours)**: Exploits intraday price swings, relying on technical patterns and high liquidity for rapid trades.

## Key Theories Behind Stock Selection

- **Value Investing** (Long-Term): Buy stocks below their intrinsic value with a "margin of safety," as pioneered by Benjamin Graham [6].
- **Momentum Trading** (Short-Term): Ride price trends driven by investor behavior, supported by Jegadeesh and Titman’s momentum studies [26].
- **Technical Analysis (Day Trading)**: Use price and volume patterns (e.g., Dow Theory, Elliott Wave) to predict intraday moves [30, 39].

## Comprehensive Metrics Table

The table below outlines key metrics for each trading horizon, including descriptions and performance ranges. Use these to screen stocks on platforms like Yahoo Finance, TradingView, or Trade Ideas. Always compare metrics to sector averages (e.g., tech P/E ~30, utilities ~15) and backtest strategies via paper trading.

| Trading Horizon | Key Theory | Focus | Metric (Full Name: Description, Poor < X, Good X–Y, Excellent > Z) | Source |
|-----------------|------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Long-Term** | Value Investing | Intrinsic value, growth | **SRI (Sharpe Ratio: Risk-Adjusted, Poor < 1, Good 1–2, Excellent > 2)**<br>Excess return (stock return minus risk-free rate, e.g., Treasuries) ÷ standard deviation. Higher values mean better returns per unit of risk. | [8] |
| | | | **PE (Price-to-Earnings Ratio: Valuation, Poor > 25, Good 15–25, Excellent < 15)**<br>Share price ÷ EPS (trailing or forward); low PE suggests undervaluation, high PE reflects growth expectations. | [0] |
| | | | **ROE (Return on Equity: Profitability, Poor < 10%, Good 10–20%, Excellent > 20%)**<br>Net Income ÷ Equity; shows how well a company uses shareholder funds. | [6] |
| | | | **Debt-to-Equity (D/E Ratio: Financial Health, Poor > 2, Good 0.5–2, Excellent < 0.5)**<br>Total Debt ÷ Equity; lower ratios indicate less risky capital structure. | [12] |
| | | | **Dividend Yield (Dividend Yield: Income, Poor < 1%, Good 1–3%, Excellent > 3%)**<br>Annual Dividend ÷ Share Price; attractive for income but check payout ratio (<60% is sustainable). | [15] |
| **Short-Term** | Momentum Trading | Trend persistence | **SRI (Sharpe Ratio: Risk-Adjusted, Poor < 0.8, Good 0.8–1.5, Excellent > 1.5)**<br>Risk-adjusted return for shorter periods; tighter due to higher volatility. | [26] |
| | | | **RSI (Relative Strength Index: Momentum, Poor > 70 or < 30, Good 30–70, Excellent 40–60)**<br>0–100 scale; <30 oversold (buy), >70 overbought (sell). | [22] |
| | | | **ATR (Average True Range: Volatility, Poor < 1%, Good 1–3%, Excellent > 3%)**<br>Daily price range; higher ATR suits trend or breakout trades. | [18] |
| | | | **Volume (Average Daily Volume: Liquidity, Poor < 100K shares, Good 100K–1M, Excellent > 1M)**<br>Daily shares traded; ensures smooth entry/exit. | [0] |
| | | | **Beta (Market Sensitivity: Risk, Poor > 1.5 or < 0.5, Good 0.5–1.5, Excellent 0.8–1.2)**<br>Volatility vs. market; ~1 tracks market, >1 amplifies moves. | [14] |
| **Day Trading** | Technical Analysis (Dow/Elliott) | Intraday volatility | **SRI (Sharpe Ratio: Risk-Adjusted, Poor < 0.5, Good 0.5–1, Excellent > 1)**<br>Risk-adjusted return for scalping; lower due to intraday noise. | [33] |
| | | | **RSI (Relative Strength Index: Momentum, Poor > 80 or < 20, Good 20–80, Excellent 30–70)**<br>Tighter for intraday; <20 strong buy, >80 strong sell. | [24] |
| | | | **HRV (High Relative Volume: Activity, Poor < 1.5x, Good 1.5–3x, Excellent > 3x)**<br>Day’s volume ÷ avg. volume; signals tradable action (e.g., gappers). | [33] |
| | | | **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price: Trend, Poor > ±2%, Good ±0.5–2%, Excellent < ±0.5%)**<br>Price weighted by volume; trade near VWAP for stability, deviations for breakouts. | [29] |
| | | | **Spread (Bid-Ask Spread: Liquidity, Poor > 0.5%, Good 0.1–0.5%, Excellent < 0.1%)**<br>Bid-ask difference; lower spreads cut costs. | [16] |

## How to Apply These Metrics

### Long-Term Trading
- **Strategy**: Screen for low PE, high ROE, low D/E, and solid dividend yield to find undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals. Use SRI to ensure risk-adjusted returns.
- **Example**: A utility stock with PE 12, ROE 18%, D/E 0.4, and 3.5% yield is a strong buy if SRI > 1.
- **Tools**: Morningstar, Bloomberg for fundamentals; Finviz for screens [15].

### Short-Term Trading
- **Strategy**: Target stocks with RSI 40–60, high ATR (>3%), and Volume >1M for momentum or reversals. Beta 0.8–1.2 balances risk.
- **Example**: A tech stock with RSI 45, ATR 4%, and Volume 2M shares after a breakout is ideal.
- **Tools**: TradingView for RSI/ATR; Barchart for momentum scans [18].

### Day Trading
- **Strategy**: Pre-market scan for HRV >2x, tight Spread (<0.1%), and VWAP proximity. RSI 30–70 confirms entries.
- **Example**: A stock with HRV 3x, Spread 0.05%, and price near VWAP post-earnings is a prime scalp.
- **Tools**: Trade Ideas for HRV scans; Thinkorswim for VWAP [33].

## Practical Tips for Traders
- **Compare to Peers**: Metrics should beat sector averages (e.g., tech vs. utilities).
- **Risk Management**: Set stop-losses (1–2% for day trading, 5–10% for others) and limit position size to 1–5% of capital.
- **Backtest**: Use paper trading to test strategies before going live.
- **Stay Updated**: Markets evolve; check real-time data on Yahoo Finance or TradingView.

## Why These Metrics Matter
- **Fundamentals (PE, ROE, D/E, Yield)**: Ensure long-term sustainability [6].
- **Momentum (RSI, ATR, Beta)**: Capture short-term price inefficiencies [26].
- **Intraday (HRV, VWAP, Spread)**: Optimize for liquidity and quick moves [33].
- **Risk-Adjusted (SRI)**: Balances reward and risk across horizons [8].
